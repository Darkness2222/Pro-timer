## Database Changes

### New Tables

#### `organization_invite_links`
Stores shareable invitation links with configuration:
- `id` - Unique link identifier
- `organization_id` - Organization this link belongs to
- `token` - Secure unique token for the URL
- `role` - Role to assign ('owner', 'admin', 'presenter')
- `created_by` - User who created the link
- `expires_at` - Optional expiration date
- `max_uses` - Maximum number of times link can be used
- `current_uses` - Current number of uses
- `is_active` - Whether link is active
- `label` - Optional description/label
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Timestamps

#### `invite_link_usage`
Tracks each use of an invite link:
- `id` - Usage record identifier
- `invite_link_id` - Link that was used
- `user_id` - User who used it (after joining)
- `email` - Email of person who used it
- `ip_address` - IP for security tracking
- `user_agent` - Browser/device info
- `accepted_at` / `created_at` - Timestamps

### Modified Tables

#### `organization_invitations`
Added columns:
- `invite_method` - How invite was sent ('email', 'link', 'qr', 'manual')
- `invite_link_id` - Reference to shareable link if applicable

## New Components

## New Utility Functions (`inviteUtils.js`)

### Link Management
- `createInviteLink()` - Generate new shareable link
- `validateInviteLink()` - Check if link is valid
- `getOrganizationInviteLinks()` - Fetch all links for org
- `deactivateInviteLink()` - Deactivate a link
- `deleteInviteLink()` - Permanently delete a link
- `getInviteLinkUsage()` - Get usage history

### Link Usage
- `recordInviteLinkUsage()` - Track when link is used

- `generateInviteLinkUrl()` - Create full URL from token
- `copyToClipboard()` - Cross-browser clipboard API

## Database Functions (PostgreSQL)

### `validate_invite_link(link_token)`
Server-side validation function that checks:
- Link exists
- Link is active
- Not expired
- Under usage limit
Returns validation status and organization info

### `increment_invite_link_usage(link_id)`
Atomically increments the usage counter for a link

### `update_updated_at_column()`
Trigger function to auto-update timestamps

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All new tables have comprehensive RLS policies:

**organization_invite_links:**
- Owners/admins can view, create, update, delete their links
- Public can view active, valid links for validation only

**invite_link_usage:**
- Owners/admins can view usage logs for their links
- Anyone can insert usage records when redeeming links

### Token Security
- Tokens generated using `gen_random_uuid()` for cryptographic randomness
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate tokens
- Cannot be guessed or brute-forced

### Usage Limits
- Configurable max uses per link
- Atomic counter prevents race conditions
- Links auto-disable when limit reached

### Expiration
- Optional expiration dates
- Server-side validation prevents expired link usage
- Clear visual indicators for expired links

## User Interface Updates
